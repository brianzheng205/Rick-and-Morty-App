# Rick-and-Morty-App
An web-based app based on Rick & Morty API. Displays all locations and for each location, displays residents' images along with their names and statuses. Clicking on a resident image will redirect user to the character's information page, which includes their name, image, status, species, type, gender, origin, and location. Also on this page, there is a form for custom notes that allows users to enter their own notes to submit to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts, a dummy API that does not use the form information.

To open app, create a virtual environment using "venv\Scripts\activate" and running "flask --app app run".
